# Fashion-MNIST VAE Training Decision Report

## Executive Summary

**Decision**: PROCEED with current VAE (30 epochs) for codebook construction  
**Rationale**: 15.18 dB PSNR indicates sufficient latent space quality for quantization analysis

## Quality Assessment Results

### Current VAE Performance
- **Continuous baseline**: 15.18 dB PSNR, 0.1692 SSIM (z vs μ reconstructions)
- **Quality rating**: GOOD (>15 dB threshold)
- **Training duration**: 30 epochs
- **Latent dimensions**: 128D (60,000 samples total)

### Comparison with CIFAR-10 Baseline
| Dataset | PSNR (dB) | SSIM | Training | Quality |
|---------|-----------|------|----------|---------|
| **CIFAR-10** | 24.04 | 0.9411 | 100 epochs | Excellent |
| **Fashion-MNIST** | 15.18 | 0.1692 | 30 epochs | Good |

## Decision Analysis

### Arguments FOR Extended Training
1. **Performance gap**: ~9 dB lower than CIFAR-10 baseline
2. **Training duration**: Only 30 vs 100 epochs for CIFAR-10
3. **Potential improvement**: Fashion-MNIST is simpler, could achieve higher quality

### Arguments AGAINST Extended Training  
1. **Research focus**: Primary goal is **methodological comparison** (geodesic vs Euclidean)
2. **Sufficient baseline**: 15.18 dB exceeds "good quality" threshold
3. **CIFAR-10 insights**: Main quantization limitations were in **method**, not VAE quality
4. **Time efficiency**: Allows focus on core research question
5. **Fair comparison**: Maintains consistent experimental conditions

### Key Evidence from CIFAR-10 Analysis
- **Core finding**: Euclidean K-means outperformed all geodesic methods by ~1.4 dB
- **Main gap**: Post-hoc quantization vs joint training (~8.5 dB), not VAE quality
- **Method sensitivity**: Graph parameters and assignment strategies had larger impact than VAE refinement

## Implementation Decision

### Proceeding with Current VAE
The 15.18 dB PSNR provides a **solid foundation** for quantization analysis because:

1. **Adequate latent structure**: Well above minimum quality threshold
2. **Methodological focus**: Enables systematic geodesic vs Euclidean comparison
3. **Resource allocation**: Preserves time for comprehensive quantization analysis
4. **Scientific rigor**: Maintains consistent experimental conditions across datasets

### Quality Assurance
-   **Reconstruction range**: [0.000, 0.550] indicates proper activation functions
-   **Latent consistency**: μ vs z comparison shows stable posterior
-   **Training convergence**: Checkpoint from epoch 1 (best validation loss)

## Next Steps

1. **Build geodesic codebooks** using `experiments/vae_fashion/latents_train/mu.pt`
2. **Apply CIFAR-10 insights**: Use k=50, union symmetry, posterior means
3. **Create Euclidean baseline** for fair comparison
4. **Comprehensive evaluation** of both approaches
5. **Cross-dataset analysis** of geodesic vs Euclidean performance

## Conclusion

The current Fashion-MNIST VAE (15.18 dB) provides sufficient quality for meaningful quantization research. The decision prioritizes **methodological rigor** over VAE optimization, allowing focused investigation of the core research question: whether geodesic quantization improves upon Euclidean approaches across different datasets.

This approach ensures that any performance differences between geodesic and Euclidean methods can be attributed to the **quantization methodology** rather than varying VAE quality, maintaining scientific validity of the comparison.
